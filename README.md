# Convolutional Neural Networks

during course I have obtained knowledge of:

1.Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Edge Detection
  - Padding
  - Strided Convolutions
  - Pooling Layers

2.Deep Convolutional Models: Case Studies
  - Classic Networks (LeNet, AlexNet)
  - ResNets
  - MobileNet
  - EfficientNet

3.Object Detection
   - Identify the components used for object detection (landmark, anchor, bounding box, grid, ...) and their purpose
   - Implement object detection
   - Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
   - Implement intersection over union
   - Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning
   - Apply sparse categorical crossentropy for pixelwise prediction
   - Implement semantic image segmentation on the CARLA self-driving car dataset
   - Explain the difference between a regular CNN and a U-net
   - Build a U-Net
4.Face recognition & Neural Style Transfer
